Actually Nvidia has to expand its semiconductor business, growth in last fiscal year and even won the 7%, these analysts have underestimated the prospects of Nvidia yet?　　Unfavorable factors and opportunities　　Nvidia face environment worse dilemma, because the traditional PC industry demand continues to slow. According to market research firm Gartner released statistical reports show a while ago in 2016, global PC shipments in the first quarter and down 9.6%, and not just a PC, Tablet PC and smart phone shipments slowed further. In addition, Nvidia licensed to Intel\'s graphics patents will soon expire in March next year, that revenue last year accounted for revenues of 5.3%.　　However, Nvidia now has two lucrative path to follow, first auto market more seriously. PWC analysis expects auto market revenue will quadruple from 2015-2020, reached $ 130 billion in the market size. Meanwhile, the market for driving assistance systems, such as the Nvidia DRIVE PX platform, during this time the annual rate of growth up to 40%, occupies the entire car market of about 43%.

Currently Nvidia has cooperation relationship with several car manufacturers, Mercedes-Benz, Audi, Porsche, Bentley, Tesla and ontology, Volvo will also pilot Nvidia programme next year. Under the best of circumstances, Nvidia took all the leading brands of automobile market as a whole.[![Alt Speck iPhone 5 Case](http://www.nodcase.com/images/large/apple_case/speck_candyshell_ip850_lrg.jpg)](http://www.nodcase.com/speck-candyshell-case-for-iphone-5-plug-card-black-p-2036.html)　　Area of the market is more exciting than a car?

Obviously, Nvidia more interested in e-sports and VR virtual reality. Globally, the vigorous development of e-sports business is alarming and huge financial payments. For example, one of the YouTube partner PewDiePie, spending $ 7 million a year game live, easy for the backing and support of the 43.5 million users.　　PWC expects competitive world of e-sports industry this year is expected to generate revenues of us $ 4.63, up 43%. Nvidia GeForce graphics cards business likely will benefit from the growing number of gamers. Last year, Nvidia released the GeForce video cards in high-end business rose 30% because of e-sports gaming. Along with the in-depth consumer games, Nvidia will become one of the main beneficiaries.　　Apart from the esports gaming market, Nvidia is expected to obtain from the VR virtual reality effective to grow in this new industry, Nvidia cooperation with the suppliers of major ecosystems. For now, the most important partner is the Oculus company Rift,GTX 970 graphics cards to fit the helmet to get a pretty good experience, at least all features to play with. Taking into account that more players would lose everything under several VR, which would not only help Nvidia revenue and are expected to increase gross margins.　　In short, Nvidia has developed from a simple video card vendors to provide comprehensive computing solutions company, if the above mentioned Nvidia can benefit stability in the area, continued to grow this year is not a difficult thing.[Article correction]Collection is the collection of 1542Tags:PC and hardware Science and technology
