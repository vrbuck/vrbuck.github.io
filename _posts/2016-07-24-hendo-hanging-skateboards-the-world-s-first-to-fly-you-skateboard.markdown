Hendo not entirely like the back to the future in the Martin flying skateboards to use when, precisely, Hendo is suspended--skateboarding pioneer in the field of product users capable of autonomous driving, self-propelled, floating platform powerful enough to support an adult\'s weight. [Juicy iPhone 6 case](http://www.nodcase.com/juicy-couture-iphone-6-case-get-it-right-p-5076.html)When a user in the initial pilot, will cast doubt on its load-bearing capacity. Arx Pax said Hendo enough now version supports more than 130 kilos in weight, and released a new version in the future, this figure will increase to more than 220 kilograms. But no matter what the result, hanging skateboards made of the primary question is, it has to be suspended above the surface in a specific, can realize the function of host objects. Hendo used the same and Maglev technology, which means that it can only float in non-ferrous metals (other than iron or steel), such as copper or aluminium.

Arx Pax founder and inventor Greg Hendo Henderson said, the company is working on by tilting suspension skateboard to control the direction of Hendo. But the reality is, because of the friction and do not feel the ground, difficult for users to control the operation of size, need to be used more than once to use.[![Alt Juicy iPhone 6 case](http://www.nodcase.com/images/large/i6/juicy_couture_i63556_lrg.jpg)](http://www.nodcase.com/juicy-couture-iphone-6-case-get-it-right-p-5076.html)![Alt Hendo hanging skateboards: the world\'s first to fly you skateboard](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8794/28395973282_b62b347784_b.jpg)Hend\'s original inspiration from the architecture. Greg Henderson says, \"If you can get the train load of 50,000 kg suspension on the ground, so a House can become possible. \"He subsequently explained, suspended building is a long-term goal, the current technology is still in its early stages of development. When the earthquake came, the building from the Foundation \"lifting\" and minimize the loss of natural disasters, it is the effect of the emergency safety systems need to be in the future. Modern suspension technology is still in its early stages, Henderson and his team will be ideas from concept to reality.![Alt Hendo hanging skateboards: the world\'s first to fly you skateboard](https://c1.staticflickr.com/9/8866/28217725690_a1acb6b85b_z.jpg)On the Kickstarter, at $ 299 to get Hendo hanging skateboard complete engine modules they want users hanging skateboards to create more of the suspended projects, Arx Pax company also will subsidize the creativity to turn it into reality. $ 100 can get 5 minutes to hang skateboards prototype experience; back in under the guidance of a personal trainer and $ 1000 for 1 hour only ten sponsored 10,000 supporters can really have a skateboard. Product release date is October 21, 2015-Martin back in the years to come.via engadget
