A Stanford University student Andrej KarPathy, issued a call Lua code, which can mimic human speech. Karpathy project page has some ideas and examples of real sampling is used to build a recurrent neural network (RNN) material, or material of human language.Recently, new media artist and Samim do a test to prove that this may very well be like Obama\'s speech. RNN Obama is based on the Lua code, first of all, Samim established a Web crawler to gather all Obama\'s public speaking and analyses the content of interviews and debates, all of which were fed into the RNN model Karpathy, then use a short paragraph intro (called seeds), the algorithm can generate a speech.Obama\'s speech and many, like \"hope\" and \"Yes we can\" is very familiar with the topic. Since 2007, Obama\'s speech-writer has written the 730895 or text, but not including interviews and debates.Algorithm to generate the Obama quote is as follows: [Victorias Secret iPhone 5 Cases](https://au.lifestyle.yahoo.com/fashion/news/a/31140529/candice-swanepoel-is-pregnant/)Seeds: war on terrorHello, thank you, and God bless the United States. We have started collecting medical insurance message in the world. We are hard working but no development.

And we\'ve got to write press releases and enjoy the photography of robots, perhaps the President\'s speech really algorithm can be used to write. via mbAttention brain micro-signal (hackmind), bring you a taste of more advanced technology![Alt If the algorithm as President, what would it say?](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1591/26392284331_0509718343.jpg)2264 votesMillet bracelet\rBracelet with millet millet\'s latest wearable device, with intelligent features such as alarm clock sleep monitoring.\rView details of the voting >>
