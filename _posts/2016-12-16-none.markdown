![Alt None](https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5552/31527730812_7a9b753c8c_z.jpg)I do not know when to start, NFC Android flagship mobile phone standard, more and more manufacturers began adding NFC functionality for their equipment. Of course, the NFC was not limited to Android manufacturers, WP camp began to add this feature. But for the average user, what is the NFC? What can you do? Should we pay more money for hardware? This article below will cut through fog, in-depth understanding of NFC.What is NFC?Near-field communication (English: Near Field Communication,NFC), also known as short-range wireless communications, is a short-range high frequency wireless communication technology allows contactless electronic devices point-to-point data transfer at 10 cm (3.9 inches), the exchange of data. This technique consists of contactless radio frequency identification (RFID) evolved, developed by Philips and Sony, which is based on RFID and interconnect technologies. NFC is a short-range high frequency wireless technology, 13.56MHz runs in 20 cm distance. 106 of its transmission speed Kbit/seconds, 212 or 424 Kbit/second Kbit/second three. Adopted as ISO/IEC IS currently near-field communication 18092 international standard, EMCA-340 standard and the ETSI TS 102 190 standard. Active and passive NFC two reading modes. (Excerpt from Wikipedia entry near field communication)When it comes to NFC we have to mention RFID, RFID is alien to you, but it has surrounded us, meal cards, bus cards, access cards, and so on as long as you use touch can pay or card uses RFID to do other things. RFID cards can be as small as a coin size, Exchange data can also be done in a few metres away. I believe we will see some autotoll lanes in highway toll station, right? It also belongs to the RFID technology. NFC is evolved in RFID, suitable for electronic devices (such as mobile phones, flat) data transmission over short distances. It can become a RFID card or into a credit card machine, or even two devices close to the exchange of data. Read the concept, the following will present some practical examples of the NFC.  NFC mobile payments [Michael Kors iPhone 6](http://www.mkfans.com/michael-kors-iphone-case)NFC is known as application should now be regarded as mobile payment, NFC has been called mobile payments revolution, but now it seems not very successful, not only are commercial users and users do not buy it, system security, and so on. However, this has only just started, and what the future is unknown, but future payments will become more simple, smart and secure.Google Wallet is currently a complete NFC payment systems, users on Android phones that support NFC function corresponding to the installed app, and binds good credit card can support businesses \"brush\" mobile phone payments. But as with all mobile payment technologies: users do not buy it. [Michael Kors iPhone 6 Cases](http://disneycase8.tumblr.com/post/131834011425/sairui-new-ios-wireless-game-controller-for-apple)Domestic markets are slightly confused, the three operators have chosen RFID-SIM to achieve mobile payments using a SIM card with a special chip, turn the mobile phone into an RFID card, such a benefit does not need the support of equipment. But there are also disadvantages, can only achieve RFID credit card functions, data exchange between mobile phones, card reader function is not possible, and it must be mobile open to credit card, the frequency is 2.45G, not 13.56M. Practical applications there are many, most of urban public transport system has already provided RFID-SIM version, such as mobile phone Shenzhen Tong, Tian Yi Yang Cheng Tong, China Unicom mobile phone card. UnionPay is the NFC, with mobile phone manufacturers pushing built-in Cup NFC smartphones, mobile started testing the waters NFC.Speaking of RFID-SIM to achieve mobile payments, we also say another mobile payment specification: Felica, which in Japan has developed, early in the NFC to reach the ideal for all applications: access control, bus, mobile payment, mobile phone transmissions. Most of the Japanese mobile Felica built-in mobile versions.Mobile FeliCa chip called the Mobile FeliCa IC Chip is determined by Sony and NTT DoCoMo venture firm FeliCa Networks developed. July 2004 using the FeliCa chip phone went on sale. Because of the FeliCa chip, so you can think of cell phones as Edy or Suica (Mobile Suica). When using Mobile FeliCa Chip before the service started, NTT DoCoMo on wallet phones have been the trademark for service identification. First and only Mobile FeliCa chip Sony manufactured, Mobile FeliCa chip later joined by Toshiba and Renesas publicly in May 2006, three companies supply. The new generation of Mobile FeliCa chips, increased capacity and communication function. Using this kind of chip phone publicly in October 2006. \"iMode FeliCa\"(NTT DoCoMo) \"EZ FeliCa\"(au by KDDI) \"S! FeliCa (old name for Vodafone! FeliCa)\"(Softbank Mobile)Because Japan\'s special mobile market, Felica in Japan do have good coverage and application, but still most of the Japan technology, develop to the abroad acclimatized. Legacy Shenzhen and Hong Kong Octopus card uses Felica specifications, has also changed in recent years.![Alt None](https://c1.staticflickr.com/1/273/31527735982_a29e82e60e.jpg) NFC easy lifeRemember the Nexus s and Galaxy Nexus of advertising? Open the address book, two NFC-enabled mobile phone back, gently touch the screen, the card will transfer over. But Android Beam is now more powerful, in addition to transport cards, can also pass applications, photographs, Web sites, and so on. In certain supported applications, such as on the Android Twitter client four times, two mobile phone touch allows other clients to show your own personal page. The low transfer rate of NFC, Android transmitted Beam is how to achieve that picture from? The answer is Bluetooth, two paired mobile touch quickly, and then start Exchange data. Nokia has launched by NFC quickly paired Bluetooth headset. NFC is not a replacement for Bluetooth can be said to be complementary, NFC solution pairing Bluetooth trouble, cannot easily transfer, Bluetooth solution NFC communication speed, transmission distance short questions.NFC can query a bus card balances, access cards and so on, also some features coming in the future, but I do not know to reach Felica Japan application how long does it take?Finally, the miracle is that you mention Japanese, Japan found an intermediate solution: infrared, two back in the face, an open receive mode, sending another. Similarly, you can also transfer photos of business cards and small form-factor. Can also be applied to control televisions, projectors and other equipment.NFC into their lives far away?For now, NFC to reach into daily life, easy life still has a long way to go. NFC is not yet a mature technology, current problems very much, not enough to NFC apply to mobile payments.Each has its own standards, most of the technology is not strong because of this problem. Google Wallet account in China UnionPay mobile payment terminal on the cash register to use? China UnionPay\'s Quick Pass to move the mobile terminal used? Each giant has his way, want to build NFC, convenient living is not realistic. Hope to have a complete NFC mobile payment standards, so as to make the NFC better in real life.NFC yet another important issue: security. Safety is every payment problem: magnetic stripe cards can be copied, so it began to replace the security to IC card; note can be forged, so we started looking for other more secure payment method. NFC is treated as a new means of payment up front, but safety was ignored. Application in Android, for example, I believe that the majority of Android users have chosen the root, then root then who is going to protect the security of NFC payment? If Google chose to prohibit root, the user will be more dissatisfied? Security is the main reason for members to choose from different directions of mobile payment, hope that the NFC will have major breakthroughs in security.The future of NFC?[![Alt Michael Kors iPhone 6](http://www.awacase.com/images/large/i6/michael_kors_i6857_lrg.jpg)](http://www.mkfans.com/michael-kors-iphone-case)Regarding whether the article mentioned at the beginning of the NFC joining select phone need to be determining factors, I would like to answer. NFC technology is still a long way to go, you need to have uniform standards, and also to resolve security issues. If hope over in the exchange of business cards, and that share of NFC mobile phones don\'t impress users, right? But the NFC as a new technology is supported by the parties, markets are also on the watch. Learn more about the new cool device, please pay attention to @ love machine
