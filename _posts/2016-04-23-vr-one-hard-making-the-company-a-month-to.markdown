![Alt VR-one hard? Making the company a month to](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1472/26316355030_36c3163e91_b.jpg)On March 16 I went to TFC General Assembly brought to a given network of Lei Feng (search for \"Lei feng\'s network\", public interest) VR/AR Media Awards, just talk about meeting Wang Longfei VR. Before he was a Shenzhen, founded the company after it has been collected in the new company in the VR machine.Prior to the meeting he says on the phone how do I to ask VR, think that\'s censure, VR how can they do need to teach me how to do it. But after a chat with found that VR this thing that they really do have a lot of doubts, better communication later learned they were doing VR machine.Shenzhen shanzhai Tablet manufacturers into VR\"Our parent company, Shenzhen shanzhai flat panel industries top manufacturers in the background,\" said Wang Longfei. \"Cottage flat sales for 8KK/years (8 million). \"This company called DAO group.DAO group is beginning to enter the VR, because at present the Tablet market has begun to decline. Wang Longfei, tablet of this product type were to be eliminated, and the next levels of 3C consumer products for civilian use is the helmet.On December 15, the new company billion border virtual reality (Emdoor VR) was founded. Initially only the boss in doing research, the team later hired Wang Longfei, by the beginning of March this year team hardware and software configured.DAO and not the overall bet on the VR, the original flat-line is still in operation, but Wang Longfei says they input into the VR \"should be higher than the General type of VR equipment startups.\"One month to build VR machineBillion border\'s first product is the VR machine, didn\'t take my cell phone boxes, Wang Longfei said because the box is too Low.They do one speed is fast, companies established in December 15, in March this year staff completed April products which will make the product, being a hardware time after only a month. How fast is the speed, compared to other startups you know. Magic mirror in February last year told Lei Feng they do one, now I have no sound and mirror the post six months ago, said the storm in one machine, there are no messages.How can do it so fast? Wang Longfei summarized it as \"primitive accumulation + preparatory + execution\" these 11 words:Preparation: study of VR, while learning the characteristics of VR equipment on the market;Primitive accumulation: the flat-panel industry origin;Execution: with its own characteristics, develop better definition and form, move it up.There are two reasons, first, they had to do OEM UCVR helmet; second, they He Ruiyue software (Nibiru), much less development work.Work quickly, does not mean doing well, Wang Longfei admitted this is positioned slightly lower-end products, \"nothing really technical highlights\", there is no interaction design, optimization has not done much work.One supply chain and cell phones high contact ratioStrictly speaking billion border done is move the VR helmet, but it is not often said that the VR machine, because the helmet and host are separated, the latter on the remote control.In addition to the features, makes it difficult to find other bright spots. Configuration of this product looks like a cell phone, using Intel processors, Samsung AMOLED screen and other chips, sensors, and systems are also used on the phone.[![Alt VR Box headset](http://www.wearkits.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/vrbox_side.jpg)](http://www.wearkits.com/)![Alt VR-one hard? Making the company a month to](https://c2.staticflickr.com/2/1655/26563351536_e5064d53b6_b.jpg)Billion border-one product configurationWang Longfei revealed that mobile VR\'s supply chain and smartphones for celebration chain is totally coincide, in addition to optical and structure. It is also no secret Fireworks workshops CEO Lou pool said, \"one computer and smart phone exactly the same upstream supply chain (note that exactly the same), without any hardware to the Smartphone industry chain is not the same. ‚ÄùBillion border do this paragraph products also using has zhiqian in flat Shang has established of based, like processor zhiqian they in flat Shang on and Intel has cooperation, Intel also is encourages manufacturers will they of processor with to new of products Shang; addition, zhiqian big friends has been shows off himself with of is Samsung of AMOLED screen, in billion border seems are nothing, \"8KK of shipping volume, what things are can took get,\" Wang Longfei said.A large wave machine is coming?According to Wang Longfei said billion border 2C VR-one not want to do, and just want to sell one scenario, we estimate the future will see a lot of \"brand of one\" was born. And millions of borders to do not just one machine, will also introduce a full range of VR products contain a variety of product forms.With the accumulation of industrial chain, million borders can quickly make a VR machine, it\'s not difficult, but hard to make a good one. One should not only put the phone into his helmet, as if this is the case, then why does one machine, direct involvement inside it.The magic mirror\'s CEO Zhang Shubin and Fireworks CEO Lou pool has said:Zhang Shubin believes that one machine can have more hardware and software optimization, it hardware and software can be customized to achieve the optimal user experience; VR also made a custom systems based on Android, dual screens and graphics has done a lot of work, is actually in the formulation of a basic standard.Lou pool view, if you move the VR still cannot break away from smart-phone software and hardware systems, the smartphone maker, will eventually be moving VR initiative. VR startup if you want to build your own moat, as innovation in hardware and software.
